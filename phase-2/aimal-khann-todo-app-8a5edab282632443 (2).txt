# Interactive Todo Console App

A simple, interactive console-based todo application built with Python.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface with step-by-step prompts
- Add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- In-memory storage (data resets when application closes)
- User-friendly wizard-style interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application directly with Python

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Available Commands

- `add` - Add a new task
- `view` or `list` - View all tasks
- `update` - Update a task
- `complete` - Mark a task as complete
- `delete` - Delete a task
- `exit` - Exit the application

### Interactive Workflow

The application follows a conversational approach:

1. Enter a command (e.g., "add")
2. The application will prompt you for the required information
3. Follow the prompts to complete your task

Example:
```
Enter command: add
Enter title: Buy groceries
Enter description: Milk, bread, eggs
Task added successfully with ID: 1
```

## Architecture

The application follows the MVC pattern:

- **Model** (`src/models.py`): Task data class
- **Controller** (`src/manager.py`): TaskManager with CRUD logic
- **View** (`src/ui.py`): InteractiveCLI for user interface
- **Entry Point** (`src/main.py`): Application initialization

## Data Storage

All data is stored in memory only. When the application is closed, all tasks are lost.

# Claude Code Rules

This file is generated during init for the selected agent.

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Spec-Driven Development (SDD). Your primary goal is to work with the architext to build products.

## Task context

**Your Surface:** You operate on a project level, providing guidance to users and executing development tasks via a defined set of tools.

**Your Success is Measured By:**
- All outputs strictly follow the user intent.
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
- Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions.
- All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.

## Core Guarantees (Product Promise)

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General → `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‑create ADRs; require user consent.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3–7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‑native flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General → `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‑native tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General → `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‑creation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‑matter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‑part test and suggest documenting with:
  "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief> — Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‑create the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps. 

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‑goals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Prompt

Create a strict Project Constitution for a Phase I Console Todo Application.

Constraints & Principles:
1. Tech Stack: Python 3.13+ managed by UV.
2. Storage: Strictly In-Memory (List/Dict). DO NOT use any external database or file storage.
3. Architecture: Modular design within a /src folder. Separate Data Model, Logic, and UI.
4. Coding Standards: PEP 8 compliant, fully type-hinted, and include docstrings for all functions.
5. User Experience: The CLI must be INTERACTIVE. Do not use complex argument parsing. Ask the user for input step-by-step (e.g., User types "add", then App asks "Enter Title:").
6. Workflow: Strictly follow Spec-Driven Development. No code is written without a Task ID.
7. Deployment: Exclude all deployment configurations (Docker/Cloud) for this phase.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Phase I Console Todo Application with 6 core principles based on the provided constraints:

1. Tech Stack Mandate - Python 3.13+ with UV
2. In-Memory Storage Constraint - No external databases
3. Modular Architecture - Separate Data Model, Logic, and UI
4. Code Quality Standards - PEP 8, type hints, docstrings
5. Interactive CLI Experience - Step-by-step prompts
6. Spec-Driven Development Compliance - Task IDs required

Also updated related templates (plan, spec, tasks) to include constitution compliance checks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational project constitution and updated templates
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this constitution creation
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution.md and 3 template files to ensure consistency
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with feature specification based on this constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear governance for future development

## Prompt

Create a Specification for the "Interactive Todo Console App".

User Stories:
1. Interactive Add: As a user, when I type "add", I want the app to ask me "Enter task title: " and then "Enter description: " so I don't have to memorize command syntax.
2. Interactive Update: As a user, when I type "update", I want the app to ask "Enter Task ID to update: ", and then ask for the new title and description.
3. Interactive Actions: As a user, when I type "delete" or "complete", I want the app to prompt me for the Task ID if I haven't provided one.
4. View Tasks: As a user, I want to see a clean list of all tasks showing [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The app must use a "Wizard" style interface (step-by-step prompts).
- It must NEVER crash if I type a wrong ID (it should just say "Invalid ID, try again").
- It must loop continuously, allowing me to enter multiple commands without restarting the app.
- Data resets when the application is closed (In-Memory only).

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the Interactive Todo Console App with 4 user stories:

1. Interactive Task Addition (P1) - Adding tasks with title and description
2. Interactive Task Update (P2) - Updating existing tasks
3. Interactive Task Actions (P3) - Delete/complete tasks by ID
4. View Tasks (P1) - Display tasks with completion status

The spec includes functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010), key entities (Task), success criteria (SC-001 to SC-004), and constitution compliance (CC-001 to CC-007).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification for interactive todo app
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.clarify or /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification aligns with constitution and user requirements

## Prompt

Generate a Technical Plan based on the Interactive Specification.

Architecture:
- Pattern: Modular MVC (Model-View-Controller).
- Model (`src/models.py`): `Task` data class (id, title, description, status).
- Controller (`src/manager.py`): `TaskManager` class containing logic (CRUD). It should strictly handle data, not user input.
- View (`src/ui.py`): `InteractiveCLI` class.
    - Instead of parsing arguments, this class must have distinct methods (e.g., `prompt_for_add`, `prompt_for_id`) that use `input()` to ask questions step-by-step.
    - Includes a main loop that prints a simple menu (Add, View, Update, Delete, Exit).
- Entry Point (`src/main.py`): Instantiates the Manager and starts the UI loop.

Project Structure:
- README.md
- src/
  - __init__.py
  - models.py
  - manager.py
  - ui.py
  - main.py

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive technical plan for the Interactive Todo Console App with:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Detailed architecture following MVC pattern with Python 3.13+, in-memory storage, and proper separation of concerns.

2. Research (research.md): Documented technology decisions including Python 3.13+ with standard library only, in-memory storage, MVC architecture, wizard-style CLI, and error handling approach.

3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defined the Task entity with fields (id, title, description, completed), validation rules, state transitions, and in-memory storage structure.

4. API Contracts (contracts/api-contracts.md): Specified interfaces for TaskManager and InteractiveCLI classes with detailed method signatures and behaviors.

5. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Provided setup instructions, usage examples, and architecture overview.

All artifacts comply with the Phase I Console Todo Application Constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete technical plan with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for planning phase
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts, and quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan aligns with MVC architecture requirements and constitution

## Prompt

Break down the Plan into granular, sequential implementation tasks.

Tasks:
1. Initialize Project: Create the `src` directory and empty `__init__.py`.
2. Data Model: Implement `src/models.py` with the `Task` data class.
3. Logic: Implement `src/manager.py` with `TaskManager` class (Add, View, Update, Delete methods).
4. Interface (CRITICAL): Implement `src/ui.py` with the `InteractiveCLI` class.
   - It MUST implement an `input()` loop.
   - When "add" is typed, call a helper that asks: `title = input("Title: ")`.
   - When "update" is typed, call a helper that asks: `id = input("ID: ")`.
   - DO NOT use argument parsing (splitting strings). Keep it conversational.
5. Entry Point: Implement `src/main.py` to start the app.
6. Documentation: Create a README.md explaining how to use the interactive menu.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation tasks for the Interactive Todo Console App with 30 specific tasks organized by user story priority:

Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003) - Project initialization
Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T008) - Core infrastructure
Phase 3: User Story 1 (T009-T013) - Interactive Task Addition (P1)
Phase 4: User Story 4 (T014-T018) - View Tasks (P1)
Phase 5: User Story 2 (T019-T023) - Interactive Task Update (P2)
Phase 6: User Story 3 (T024-T029) - Interactive Task Actions (P3)
Phase N: Polish (T030-T035) - Cross-cutting concerns

All tasks follow the required format: [ ] T### [P?] [US#?] Description with file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed task breakdown for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for task creation
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with organized task structure
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story for independent development

## Prompt

Execute all defined tasks to build the Interactive Todo App.

Implementation Guidelines:
1. Strict File Placement: All Python code must go inside the `src/` directory.
2. Interactive UI: The `src/ui.py` implementation must be conversational.
   - Example: If the user types "add", the program pauses and asks "Enter Title:".
   - Do NOT try to parse arguments like `add <title>`.
3. Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid ID (like "abc"), catch the error and print "Please enter a valid number" instead of crashing.
4. Clean Code: Ensure all files have type hints and docstrings as per the Constitution.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the Interactive Todo Console App with all required functionality:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Created src/ directory with proper module structure

================================================
FILE: specs/001-interactive-todo-app/data-model.md
================================================
# Data Model: Interactive Todo Console App

## Entity: Task

### Fields
- **id**: `int` - Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each task
- **title**: `str` - Title of the task (required, non-empty)
- **description**: `str` - Detailed description of the task (optional, can be empty)
- **completed**: `bool` - Status indicating whether the task is completed (default: False)

### Validation Rules
- **id**: Must be a positive integer, auto-generated and unique within the session
- **title**: Must be a non-empty string with length > 0
- **description**: Can be empty string, no length restrictions
- **completed**: Boolean value only (True/False)

### State Transitions
- **Creation**: `completed` defaults to `False` when a new task is created
- **Completion**: `completed` changes from `False` to `True` when user marks task as complete
- **Uncompletion**: `completed` changes from `True` to `False` when user unmarks task (if supported)
- **Deletion**: Task is removed from the in-memory collection entirely

### Relationships
- No relationships with other entities (standalone entity)

### Example Representation
```python
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "description": "Milk, bread, eggs, fruits",
    "completed": False
}
```

### Collection Structure
- **In-Memory Storage**: List of Task dictionaries: `[task1, task2, ...]`
- **Access Pattern**: Tasks accessed by ID (integer), requiring lookup in the list
- **Indexing**: For performance, maintain an auxiliary dictionary mapping ID to task for O(1) lookups: `{id: task, ...}`

# Implementation Plan: Interactive Todo Console App

**Branch**: `001-interactive-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: [specs/001-interactive-todo-app/spec.md](specs/001-interactive-todo-app/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-interactive-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of an interactive console-based todo application following the MVC pattern. The application provides a wizard-style interface with step-by-step prompts for all operations. The architecture separates concerns into Model (Task data class), Controller (TaskManager with CRUD logic), and View (InteractiveCLI for user interaction). The application uses in-memory storage only and provides a continuous loop for user interaction without restart.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as required by constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external dependencies beyond Python 3.13+ standard library)
**Storage**: In-memory using Python lists and dictionaries (as required by constitution)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration testing
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application with modular architecture
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for all operations, minimal memory usage
**Constraints**: No external database, no file storage, console-only interface, wizard-style prompts required
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, up to 1000 tasks in memory, session-based data only

## Constitution Check

# Quickstart Guide: Interactive Todo Console App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+ installed
- UV package manager installed

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies: `uv sync` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the Application
1. Execute: `python src/main.py`
2. The application will start with a menu showing available options
3. Follow the interactive prompts to add, view, update, complete, or delete tasks

## Basic Usage

### Adding a Task
1. Select "Add" from the main menu
2. Enter the task title when prompted
3. Enter the task description when prompted
4. The task will be added to your list

### Viewing Tasks
1. Select "View" from the main menu
2. All tasks will be displayed with [ ] for incomplete and [x] for completed tasks

### Updating a Task
1. Select "Update" from the main menu
2. Enter the Task ID when prompted
3. Enter the new title when prompted
4. Enter the new description when prompted

### Completing a Task
1. Select "Complete" from the main menu
2. Enter the Task ID when prompted
3. The task will be marked as completed

### Deleting a Task
1. Select "Delete" from the main menu
2. Enter the Task ID when prompted
3. The task will be removed from your list

## Error Handling
- If you enter an invalid Task ID, the application will show "Invalid ID, try again" and prompt you again
- The application will never crash due to invalid input
- Empty titles will be rejected with a prompt to enter a valid title

## Architecture Overview
The application follows the MVC pattern:
- **Model (src/models.py)**: Task data class
- **Controller (src/manager.py)**: TaskManager with CRUD operations
- **View (src/ui.py)**: InteractiveCLI for user interface
- **Entry Point (src/main.py)**: Orchestrates the components


================================================
FILE: specs/001-interactive-todo-app/research.md
================================================
# Research: Interactive Todo Console App

## Decision: Python 3.13+ with Standard Library Only
**Rationale**: Aligns with constitution requirement for Python 3.13+ and minimal dependencies. Using only standard library ensures no external dependencies beyond what's required for core functionality, meeting the constitution's Technology Scope Limitation.

## Decision: In-Memory Storage with Lists/Dictionaries
**Rationale**: Directly satisfies the In-Memory Storage Constraint from the constitution. Python's built-in data structures (list for task collection, dict for individual tasks) provide efficient storage without external dependencies.

## Decision: MVC Architecture Pattern
**Rationale**: Satisfies the Modular Architecture requirement from the constitution by clearly separating concerns into Model (data structure), View (UI/presentation), and Controller (business logic). This pattern provides clean separation as mandated.

## Decision: Wizard-Style Interactive CLI
**Rationale**: Meets the Interactive CLI Experience requirement from the constitution. Using Python's built-in `input()` function provides the step-by-step prompting required without complex argument parsing.

## Decision: Data Model Design
**Rationale**: The Task entity will use a data class with auto-incrementing integer ID, title, description, and boolean completion status, providing all required attributes while maintaining simplicity.

## Decision: Error Handling Approach
**Rationale**: Will implement try-catch blocks around ID validation to ensure the application never crashes when users enter wrong IDs, displaying "Invalid ID, try again" as specified in requirements.

## Decision: Continuous Loop Implementation
**Rationale**: Will use a while-true loop with a menu system that continues until the user selects an exit option, meeting the requirement for continuous operation without restart.

## Alternatives Considered:
- **Storage**: Considered SQLite for more advanced features but rejected due to constitution's in-memory requirement
- **Architecture**: Considered monolithic design but rejected in favor of MVC to meet modular architecture requirements
- **UI Framework**: Considered argparse for command parsing but rejected in favor of step-by-step prompts as required
- **Data Structure**: Considered using named tuples instead of data classes but data classes provide better mutability for updates

================================================
# Feature Specification: Interactive Todo Console App

**Feature Branch**: `001-interactive-todo-app`
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a Specification for the Interactive Todo Console App. User Stories: 1. Interactive Add: As a user, when I type add, I want the app to ask me Enter task title:  and then Enter description:  so I don't have to memorize command syntax. 2. Interactive Update: As a user, when I type update, I want the app to ask Enter Task ID to update: , and then ask for the new title and description. 3. Interactive Actions: As a user, when I type delete or complete, I want the app to prompt me for the Task ID if I haven't provided one. 4. View Tasks: As a user, I want to see a clean list of all tasks showing [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete. Acceptance Criteria: The app must use a Wizard style interface (step-by-step prompts). It must NEVER crash if I type a wrong ID (it should just say Invalid ID, try again). It must loop continuously, allowing me to enter multiple commands without restarting the app. Data resets when the application is closed (In-Memory only)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Interactive Task Addition (Priority: P1)

As a user, when I type "add", I want the app to ask me "Enter task title: " and then "Enter description: " so I don't have to memorize command syntax.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to create tasks, which is fundamental to the entire todo application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering "add" command, providing a title and description, and verifying that a new task is created and displayed in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is at the main prompt, **When** user types "add" and provides a title and description, **Then** a new task is created with the provided details and shown in the task list
2. **Given** user is adding a task, **When** user provides empty title, **Then** the system asks for the title again with appropriate validation message

---

### User Story 2 - Interactive Task Update (Priority: P2)

As a user, when I type "update", I want the app to ask "Enter Task ID to update: ", and then ask for the new title and description.

**Why this priority**: Allows users to modify existing tasks, which is a critical feature for maintaining accurate todo lists.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task, using "update" command with a valid ID, and verifying that the task details are updated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user types "update" and provides a valid Task ID, **Then** the system prompts for new title and description
2. **Given** user provides an invalid Task ID during update, **When** user enters "update" with non-existent ID, **Then** the system shows "Invalid ID, try again" and allows re-entry

---

### User Story 3 - Interactive Task Actions (Priority: P3)

As a user, when I type "delete" or "complete", I want the app to prompt me for the Task ID if I haven't provided one.

**Why this priority**: Enables users to manage their tasks by removing completed items or marking them as complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using "delete" or "complete" commands with valid and invalid IDs, verifying appropriate responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user types "delete" and provides a valid Task ID, **Then** the task is removed from the list
2. **Given** user provides an invalid Task ID during delete/complete, **When** user enters command with non-existent ID, **Then** the system shows "Invalid ID, try again" and allows re-entry

---

### User Story 4 - View Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see a clean list of all tasks showing [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete.

**Why this priority**: Essential for users to see their tasks and their status, which is the primary purpose of a todo application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple tasks, marking some as complete, and verifying the display format shows [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has multiple tasks, **When** user enters "list" or "view" command, **Then** all tasks are displayed with proper completion indicators
2. **Given** user has no tasks, **When** user enters "list" command, **Then** the system shows appropriate message "No tasks available"

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user enters invalid command? System should show available commands and prompt again.
- How does system handle empty title or description during add/update? System should prompt for valid input.
- What happens when user enters wrong ID? System must show "Invalid ID, try again" and not crash.
- How does system handle empty task list? Should display appropriate message instead of empty list.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a wizard-style interface with step-by-step prompts for all operations

# Tasks: Interactive Todo Console App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-interactive-todo-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks MUST comply with Phase I Console Todo Application Constitution:
- Tech Stack: Python 3.13+ with UV package manager
- Storage: In-memory only (no external databases or file storage)
- Architecture: Modular design with separate Data Model, Logic, and UI
- Code Quality: PEP 8 compliant, fully type-hinted, with docstrings
- User Experience: Interactive CLI with step-by-step prompts
- Development: Spec-Driven Development with Task IDs
- Deployment: No deployment configurations for Phase I

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [X] T002 [P] Create src directory with empty __init__.py file
- [X] T003 [P] Create pyproject.toml with Python 3.13+ requirement

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [X] T013 [US1] Update main loop in src/ui.py to recognize "add" command and route to add handler

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 4 - View Tasks (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Display all tasks with [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple tasks, marking some as complete, and verifying the display format shows [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete tasks.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T014 [US4] Implement get_all_tasks method in src/manager.py that returns all tasks
- [X] T015 [US4] Implement display_tasks method in src/ui.py that formats and prints tasks with [x]/[ ] indicators
- [X] T016 [US4] Implement view command handler in InteractiveCLI that connects manager to display
- [X] T017 [US4] Update main loop in src/ui.py to recognize "view" or "list" command and route to view handler
- [X] T018 [US4] Handle empty task list case with appropriate message

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 4 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 2 - Interactive Task Update (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow users to update existing tasks by ID

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task, using "update" command with a valid ID, and verifying that the task details are updated.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T019 [US2] Implement update_task method in src/manager.py that updates title/description by ID
- [X] T020 [US2] Implement prompt_for_id method in src/ui.py that asks for task ID using input()
- [X] T021 [US2] Implement update command handler in InteractiveCLI that connects UI prompts to manager
- [X] T022 [US2] Add error handling for invalid IDs in update process
- [X] T023 [US2] Update main loop in src/ui.py to recognize "update" command and route to update handler

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 4, AND 2 should all work independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - Interactive Task Actions (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Allow users to delete or complete tasks by ID

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using "delete" or "complete" commands with valid and invalid IDs, verifying appropriate responses.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T024 [US3] Implement delete_task method in src/manager.py that removes tasks by ID

- [X] T027 [US3] Implement complete command handler in InteractiveCLI that connects UI prompts to manager
- [X] T028 [US3] Update main loop in src/ui.py to recognize "delete" and "complete" commands
- [X] T029 [US3] Add comprehensive error handling for invalid IDs with "Invalid ID, try again" message

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T030 [P] Add docstrings to all functions and classes in all modules
- [X] T031 [P] Ensure all code is PEP 8 compliant and fully type-hinted
- [X] T032 Add error handling to prevent crashes when invalid IDs are entered
- [X] T033 Add continuous loop functionality that continues until user exits
- [X] T034 Implement proper menu display showing available commands
- [X] T035 Run quickstart.md validation to ensure all functionality works as expected

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May depend on US1 for data to display
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US4 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2/US4 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 4
   - Developer C: User Story 2
   - Developer D: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

# API Contracts: Interactive Todo Console App

## TaskManager Contract

### Methods

#### `add_task(title: str, description: str) -> int`
- **Purpose**: Creates a new task with the given title and description
- **Input**:
  - `title`: Non-empty string representing task title

- **Input**:
  - `task_id`: Integer representing the task to update
  - `title`: Optional new title (if None, current title preserved)
  - `description`: Optional new description (if None, current description preserved)
- **Output**: Boolean indicating success (True) or failure (False)
- **Behavior**: Updates specified fields of existing task, returns True if successful

#### `complete_task(task_id: int) -> bool`
- **Purpose**: Marks a task as completed
- **Input**: `task_id`: Integer representing the task to mark complete
- **Output**: Boolean indicating success (True) or failure (False)

- **Behavior**: Removes the task from the in-memory collection

## InteractiveCLI Contract

### Methods

#### `prompt_for_add() -> tuple`
- **Purpose**: Prompts user for task title and description
- **Input**: None (reads from stdin)
- **Output**: Tuple containing (title: str, description: str)
- **Behavior**: Interactively asks user for title and description, validates input

#### `prompt_for_id(prompt_text: str) -> int`
- **Purpose**: Prompts user for a task ID with custom prompt
- **Input**: `prompt_text`: String with the prompt message to show
- **Output**: Integer representing the task ID
- **Behavior**: Asks user for an ID, validates it's a valid integer

#### `display_tasks(tasks: list) -> None`
- **Purpose**: Displays all tasks in a formatted way
- **Input**: `tasks`: List of task dictionaries
- **Output**: None (writes to stdout)
- **Behavior**: Formats and prints tasks with [x] for completed and [ ] for incomplete

#### `show_menu() -> None`
- **Purpose**: Displays the main menu options
- **Input**: None (writes to stdout)
- **Output**: None
- **Behavior**: Shows available options to the user (Add, View, Update, Delete, Exit)

#### `get_user_choice() -> str`
- **Purpose**: Gets the user's menu choice
- **Input**: None (reads from stdin)
- **Output**: String representing the user's choice
- **Behavior**: Prompts user for menu selection and returns it

description: Review planning artifacts for architecturally significant decisions and create ADRs.

# COMMAND: Analyze planning artifacts and document architecturally significant decisions as ADRs

## CONTEXT

The user has completed feature planning and needs to:

- Identify architecturally significant technical decisions from plan.md
- Document these decisions as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Ensure team alignment on technical approach before implementation
- Create a permanent, reviewable record of why decisions were made

Architecture Decision Records capture decisions that:

- Impact how engineers write or structure software
- Have notable tradeoffs or alternatives
- Will likely be questioned or revisited later

**User's additional input:**

$ARGUMENTS

## YOUR ROLE

Act as a senior software architect with expertise in:

- Technical decision analysis and evaluation
- System design patterns and tradeoffs
- Enterprise architecture documentation
- Risk assessment and consequence analysis

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE (with quick flywheel hooks)

Execute this workflow in 6 sequential steps. At Steps 2 and 4, apply lightweight Analyze→Measure checks:
 - Analyze: Identify likely failure modes, specifically:
     - Over-granular ADRs: ADRs that document decisions which are trivial, low-impact, or do not affect architectural direction (e.g., naming conventions, minor refactorings).
     - Missing alternatives: ADRs that do not list at least one alternative approach considered.
 - Measure: Apply the following checklist grader (PASS only if all are met):
     - The ADR documents a decision that clusters related changes or impacts multiple components (not a trivial/single-file change).
     - The ADR explicitly lists at least one alternative approach, with rationale.
     - The ADR includes clear pros and cons for the chosen approach and alternatives.
     - The ADR is concise but sufficiently detailed for future reference.

## Step 1: Load Planning Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS.

Derive absolute paths:

- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md (REQUIRED - abort if missing with "Run /sp.plan first")
- RESEARCH = FEATURE_DIR/research.md (if exists)
- DATA_MODEL = FEATURE_DIR/data-model.md (if exists)
- CONTRACTS_DIR = FEATURE_DIR/contracts/ (if exists)

## Step 2: Extract Architectural Decisions (Analyze)

Load plan.md and available artifacts. Extract architecturally significant decisions as **decision clusters** (not atomic choices):

**✅ GOOD (Clustered):**

- "Frontend Stack" (Next.js + Tailwind + Vercel as integrated solution)
- "Authentication Approach" (JWT strategy + Auth0 + session handling)
- "Data Architecture" (PostgreSQL + Redis caching + migration strategy)

**❌ BAD (Over-granular):**

- Separate ADRs for Next.js, Tailwind, and Vercel
- Separate ADRs for each library choice

**Clustering Rules:**

- Group technologies that work together and would likely change together
- Separate only if decisions are independent and could diverge
- Example: Frontend stack vs Backend stack = 2 ADRs (can evolve independently)
- Example: Next.js + Tailwind + Vercel = 1 ADR (integrated, change together)

For each decision cluster, note: what was decided, why, where in docs.

## Step 3: Check Existing ADRs

Scan `history/adr/` directory. For each extracted decision:

- If covered by existing ADR → note reference
- If conflicts with existing ADR → flag conflict
- If not covered → mark as ADR candidate

## Step 4: Apply Significance Test (Measure)

For each ADR candidate, test:

- Does it impact how engineers write/structure software?
- Are there notable tradeoffs or alternatives?
- Will it be questioned or revisited later?

Only proceed with ADRs that pass ALL three tests.

## Step 5: Create ADRs (Improve)

For each qualifying decision cluster:

1. Generate concise title reflecting the cluster (e.g., "Frontend Technology Stack" not "Use Next.js")
2. Run `create-adr.sh "<title>"` from repo root
3. Parse JSON response for `adr_path` and `adr_id`
4. Read created file (contains template with {{PLACEHOLDERS}})
5. Fill ALL placeholders:
   - `{{TITLE}}` = decision cluster title
   - `{{STATUS}}` = "Proposed" or "Accepted"
   - `{{DATE}}` = today (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `{{CONTEXT}}` = situation, constraints leading to decision cluster
   - `{{DECISION}}` = list ALL components of cluster (e.g., "Framework: Next.js 14, Styling: Tailwind CSS v3, Deployment: Vercel")
   - `{{CONSEQUENCES}}` = outcomes, tradeoffs, risks for the integrated solution
   - `{{ALTERNATIVES}}` = alternative clusters (e.g., "Remix + styled-components + Cloudflare")
   - `{{REFERENCES}}` = plan.md, research.md, data-model.md
6. Save file

## Step 6: Report Completion

Output:

```
✅ ADR Review Complete - Created N ADRs, referenced M existing
```

List created ADRs with ID and title.

If conflicts detected:

```
⚠️ Conflicts with existing ADRs [IDs]. Review and update outdated decisions or revise plan.
```

If create-adr.sh fails: Report script error and skip that ADR.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

Present results in this exact structure:

```
✅ ADR Review Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 Created ADRs: {count}
   - ADR-{id}: {title}
   - ADR-{id}: {title}

📚 Referenced Existing: {count}
   - ADR-{id}: {title}

⚠️  Conflicts Detected: {count}
   - ADR-{id}: {conflict description}

Next Steps:
→ Resolve conflicts before proceeding to /sp.tasks
→ Review created ADRs with team
→ Update plan.md if needed

Acceptance Criteria (PASS only if all true)
- Decisions are clustered (not atomic), with explicit alternatives and tradeoffs
- Consequences cover both positive and negative outcomes
- References link back to plan and related docs
```

## ERROR HANDLING

If plan.md missing:

- Display: "❌ Error: plan.md not found. Run /sp.plan first to generate planning artifacts."
- Exit gracefully without creating any ADRs

If create-adr.sh fails:

- Display exact error message
- Skip that ADR and continue with others
- Report partial completion at end

## TONE

Be thorough, analytical, and decision-focused. Emphasize the "why" behind each decision and its long-term implications.

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

description: Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/sp.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/sp.analyze`.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From constitution:**

- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/sp.implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /sp.specify with refinement", "Run /sp.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)

FILE: .claude/commands/sp.checklist.md

description: Generate a custom checklist for the current feature based on user requirements.
---

## Checklist Purpose: "Unit Tests for English"

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Checklists are **UNIT TESTS FOR REQUIREMENTS WRITING** - they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements in a given domain.

**NOT for verification/testing**:

- ❌ NOT "Verify the button clicks correctly"
- ❌ NOT "Test error handling works"
- ❌ NOT "Confirm the API returns 200"
- ❌ NOT checking if code/implementation matches the spec

**FOR requirements quality validation**:

- ✅ "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined for all card types?" (completeness)
- ✅ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" (clarity)
- ✅ "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" (consistency)
- ✅ "Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation?" (coverage)
- ✅ "Does the spec define what happens when logo image fails to load?" (edge cases)

**Metaphor**: If your spec is code written in English, the checklist is its unit test suite. You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.
   - All file paths must be absolute.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:
   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks
   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content
   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Prefer precision over breadth

   Generation algorithm:
   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators ("critical", "must", "compliance"), stakeholder hints ("QA", "review", "security team"), and explicit deliverables ("a11y", "rollback", "contracts").
   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.
   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.
   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.
   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:
      - Scope refinement (e.g., "Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?")
      - Risk prioritization (e.g., "Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?")
      - Depth calibration (e.g., "Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?")
      - Audience framing (e.g., "Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?")
      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., "Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?")
      - Scenario class gap (e.g., "No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?")

   Question formatting rules:
   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters
   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer
   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said
   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: "Confirm whether X belongs in scope."

   Defaults when interaction impossible:
   - Depth: Standard
   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise
   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters

   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., "Unresolved recovery path risk"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.

3. **Understand user request**: Combine `$ARGUMENTS` + clarifying answers:
   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)
   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user
   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding
   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)

4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope
   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies
   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks

   **Context Loading Strategy**:
   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)
   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets
   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected
   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text

5. **Generate checklist** - Create "Unit Tests for Requirements":
   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Generate unique checklist filename:
     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)
     - Format: `[domain].md`
     - If file exists, append to existing file
   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001
   - Each `/sp.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)

   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:
   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?
   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?
   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?
   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?
   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?

   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:
   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)
   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)
   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)
   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)
   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)
   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)
   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)
   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)
   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)

   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - "Unit Tests for English"**:

   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):
   - "Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards"
   - "Test hover states work on desktop"
   - "Confirm logo click navigates home"

   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):
   - "Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?" [Completeness]
   - "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" [Clarity]
   - "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" [Consistency]
   - "Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?" [Coverage]
   - "Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?" [Edge Cases]
   - "Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?" [Completeness]
   - "Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?" [Clarity]

   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:
   Each item should follow this pattern:
   - Question format asking about requirement quality
   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan
   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]
   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements
   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements

   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:

   Completeness:
   - "Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]"
   - "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]"
   - "Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]"

   Clarity:
   - "Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]"
   - "Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]"
   - "Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]"

   Consistency:
   - "Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]"
   - "Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]"

   Coverage:
   - "Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]"
   - "Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]"
   - "Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]"

   Measurability:
   - "Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]"
   - "Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]"

   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):
   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios
   - For each scenario class, ask: "Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?"
   - If scenario class missing: "Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]"
   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: "Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]"

   **Traceability Requirements**:
   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference
   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`
   - If no ID system exists: "Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]"

   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):
   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:
   - Ambiguities: "Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]"
   - Conflicts: "Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]"
   - Assumptions: "Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]"
   - Dependencies: "Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]"
   - Missing definitions: "Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]"

   **Content Consolidation**:
   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact
   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect
   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: "Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]"

   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:
   - ❌ Any item starting with "Verify", "Test", "Confirm", "Check" + implementation behavior
   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior
   - ❌ "Displays correctly", "works properly", "functions as expected"
   - ❌ "Click", "navigate", "render", "load", "execute"
   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures
   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)

   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:
   - ✅ "Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?"
   - ✅ "Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?"
   - ✅ "Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?"
   - ✅ "Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?"
   - ✅ "Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?"
   - ✅ "Does the spec define [missing aspect]?"

6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.

7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:
   - Focus areas selected
   - Depth level
   - Actor/timing
   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated

**Important**: Each `/sp.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:

- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)
- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose
- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder

To avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.

## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items

**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`

Sample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):

- "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]"
- "Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]"
- "Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]"
- "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]"
- "Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]"
- "Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]"

**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`

Sample items:

- "Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]"
- "Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]"
- "Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]"
- "Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]"
- "Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]"

**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`

Sample items:

- "Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]"
- "Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]"
- "Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]"
- "Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]"
- "Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]"

**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`

Sample items:

- "Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]"
- "Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]"
- "Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]"
- "Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]"
- "Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]"

## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do

**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]
```

**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 - Can "visual hierarchy" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]
```

**Key Differences:**

- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly
- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly
- Wrong: Verification of behavior
- Correct: Validation of requirement quality
- Wrong: "Does it do X?"
- Correct: "Is X clearly specified?"

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.

Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/sp.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/sp.specify` or verify feature branch environment.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Functional Scope & Behavior:
   - Core user goals & success criteria
   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
   - User roles / personas differentiation

   Domain & Data Model:
   - Entities, attributes, relationships
   - Identity & uniqueness rules
   - Lifecycle/state transitions
   - Data volume / scale assumptions

   Interaction & UX Flow:
   - Critical user journeys / sequences
   - Error/empty/loading states
   - Accessibility or localization notes

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

   Integration & External Dependencies:
   - External services/APIs and failure modes
   - Data import/export formats
   - Protocol/versioning assumptions

   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
   - Negative scenarios
   - Rate limiting / throttling
   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

   Terminology & Consistency:
   - Canonical glossary terms
   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

   Completion Signals:
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

   Misc / Placeholders:
   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:
    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.
    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.

4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‑choice questions:
       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
          - Best practices for the project type
          - Common patterns in similar implementations
          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec
       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).
       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`
       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:

       | Option | Description |
       |--------|-------------|
       | A | <Option A description> |
       | B | <Option B description> |
       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |
       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |

       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`
    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):
       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.
       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`
       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`
    - After the user answers:
       - If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.
       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
       - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
       - You reach 5 asked questions.
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.
   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.

7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.

8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
   - Number of questions asked & answered.
   - Path to updated spec.
   - Sections touched (list names).
   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/sp.plan` or run `/sp.clarify` again later post-plan.
   - Suggested next command.

Behavior rules:

- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/sp.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

Context for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

description: An autonomous Git agent that intelligently executes git workflows. Your task is to intelligently executes git workflows to commit the work and create PR.
---

Your task is to intelligently executes git workflows to commit the work and create PR following your Principles

# Agentic Git Workflow Agent

## Core Principle

You are an autonomous Git agent. Your job is to **fulfill the user's intent efficiently**. You have agency to:
- Analyze the current state independently
- Make intelligent decisions about the best workflow
- Execute steps without asking permission for each one
- Invoke the human validator only when the decision requires their judgment

The human is not a step-orchestrator. The human is an **intent-provider** and **decision validator**.

## Your Agency

You can autonomously:
✅ Analyze repository state  
✅ Determine optimal branch strategy  
✅ Generate meaningful commit messages based on code changes  
✅ Create branches, commits, and push to remote  
✅ Create PRs with intelligent titles and descriptions  
✅ Detect and handle common errors  

You CANNOT autonomously:
❌ Run long-running processes (servers, watchers, etc.)  
❌ Execute code that blocks indefinitely  
❌ Make changes outside the repo (create files elsewhere, etc.)  
❌ Execute destructive commands without explicit approval  

You invoke the human when:
🔴 The intent is ambiguous  
🔴 Multiple equally-valid strategies exist and you need to know their preference  
🔴 You detect something risky or unexpected  
🔴 The outcome differs significantly from what was requested  
🔴 Any non-Git command would run indefinitely or block execution  

## Phase 1: Context Gathering (Autonomous)

Start by understanding the complete situation:

```bash
git --version                        # Verify Git exists
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree  # Verify we're in a repo
git status --porcelain               # See what changed
git diff --stat                      # Quantify changes
git log --oneline -5                 # Recent history context
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD      # Current branch
git remote -v                        # Remote configuration
```

**CRITICAL:** Only run Git commands. Do not:
- Run `python main.py`, `npm start`, `make`, or other build/start scripts
- Execute anything that might be long-running or blocking
- Run tests, servers, or development tools

If Git is not available or this isn't a repo, **invoke human validator** with the problem.

## Phase 2: Analyze & Decide (Autonomous)

Based on the gathered context, **you decide** the optimal approach:

### Decision Tree:

**Are there uncommitted changes?**
- Yes → Continue to strategy decision
- No → Invoke human: "No changes detected. What would you like to commit?"

**What's the nature of changes?** (Analyze via `git diff`)
- New feature files → Feature branch strategy
- Tests only → Test/fix branch strategy
- Documentation → Docs branch strategy
- Mixed/refactor → Analysis-dependent

**What branch are we on?**
- `main` or `master` or protected branch → Must create feature branch
- Feature branch with tracking → Commit and optionally create/update PR
- Detached HEAD or unusual state → Invoke human

**What strategy is optimal?**

1. **If feature branch doesn't exist yet:**
   - Create feature branch from current base
   - Commit changes
   - Push with upstream tracking
   - Create PR to main/dev/appropriate base

2. **If feature branch exists with upstream:**
   - Commit to current branch
   - Push updates
   - Check if PR exists; create if not

3. **If on protected branch with changes:**
   - Create feature branch from current state
   - Move changes to new branch
   - Commit and push
   - Create PR

**Make this decision autonomously.** You don't need permission to decide—only when the choice itself is uncertain.

## Phase 3: Generate Intelligent Content (Autonomous)

### Branch Name
Analyze the changes to create a meaningful branch name:
```bash
git diff --name-only
```

Look at:
- Files changed (domain extraction)
- Commit intent (if user provided one)
- Repository conventions (existing branch names via `git branch -r`)

Generate a name that's:
- Descriptive (2-4 words)
- Follows existing conventions
- Reflects the actual change

Examples:
- `add-auth-validation` (from "Add login validation" + auth-related files)
- `fix-query-timeout` (from files in db/queries/)
- `docs-update-readme` (from README.md changes)

### Commit Message
Analyze the code diff and generate a conventional commit:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body explaining why, not what>
```

- **type**: feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, test (determined from change analysis)
- **scope**: Primary area affected
- **subject**: Imperative, what this commit does
- **body**: Why this change was needed

**Do not ask the user for a commit message.** Extract intent from:
- Their stated purpose (if provided)
- The code changes themselves
- File modifications

### PR Title & Description
Create automatically:
- **Title**: Based on commit message or user intent
- **Description**: 
  - What changed
  - Why it matters
  - Files affected
  - Related issues (if detectable)

## Phase 4: Execute (Autonomous)

Execute the workflow you decided:

```bash
git add .
git checkout -b           # or git switch if branch exists
git commit -m ""
git push -u origin 
gh pr create --title "" --body ""
```

Handle common errors autonomously:
- `git push` fails (auth/permission) → Report clearly, suggest manual push
- `gh` not available → Provide manual PR URL: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<branch>`
- Merge conflicts → Stop and invoke human

## Phase 5: Validate & Report (Conditional)

**After execution, evaluate the outcome:**

Compare your executed workflow against the user's original intent.

**If outcome matches intent:** ✅ Report success
```
✅ Workflow executed successfully:
  • Branch: feature/add-auth-validation
  • Commit: "feat(auth): add login validation"
  • PR: https://github.com/...
```

**If outcome differs significantly:** 🔴 Invoke human validator
```
⚠️ Outcome differs from intent:
  • Your intent: "Update documentation"
  • Actual changes: 15 files modified, 3 new features detected
  
Does this reflect what you wanted? If not, what should I have done?
```

**If something was unexpected:** 🔴 Invoke human validator
```
⚠️ Unexpected state detected:
  • On protected branch 'main'
  • User provided intent but no files changed
  • Branch already has open PR
  
What should I do?
```

## When to Invoke Human Validator

Use the `invoke_human` tool when:

### 1. Ambiguous Intent
**User said:** "Do the thing"  
**You need:** Clarification on what "the thing" is

### 2. Risk Detected
**Scenario:** Changes affect core system, or branch already exists with different content  
**Action:** Ask for confirmation: "I detected this might break X. Continue? [Y/n]"

### 3. Multiple Valid Strategies
**Scenario:** Could create new branch OR commit to existing, both valid  
**Action:** Present the decision: "I can do [A] or [B]. Which do you prefer?"

### 4. Outcome Validation
**Scenario:** Workflow executed but results differ from intent  
**Action:** Ask: "Does this match what you wanted?"

### 5. Environment Issues
**Scenario:** Git/GitHub not configured, credentials missing, unexpected state  
**Action:** Explain the blocker and ask for guidance

## Format for Human Invocation

When you need to invoke the human validator, format clearly:

```
🔴 DECISION NEEDED

Situation: <What you're trying to do>
Problem/Options: <Why you need human input>

Option A: <First approach>
Option B: <Second approach>

What would you prefer? [A/B/other]
```

Or for validation:

```
✅ OUTCOME VALIDATION

I executed: <What I did>
Result: <What happened>

Does this match your intent? [Y/n]
If not, what should I have done?
```

## What You Decide Autonomously

✅ Branch strategy  
✅ Branch naming  
✅ Commit message generation  
✅ PR creation  
✅ Workflow execution (Git only)  
✅ Error recovery (when possible)  
✅ Reading files to analyze changes  

## What You NEVER Do Autonomously

❌ Run servers, watchers, or development tools  
❌ Execute build steps unless explicitly asked  
❌ Run tests or other processes  
❌ Execute anything that blocks or runs indefinitely  
❌ Run commands outside of Git operations  

## What Requires Human Input

🔴 Clarifying ambiguous intent  
🔴 Choosing between equally valid strategies  
🔴 Confirming risky actions  
🔴 Validating outcomes don't match intent  
🔴 Resolving blockers  

## Example Execution

**User Intent:** "I added email validation to the auth system"

**You (autonomous):**
1. Gather context → See auth files + validation logic changes
2. Decide → Create feature branch, conventional commit, PR to main
3. Generate → Branch: `add-email-validation`, Commit: "feat(auth): add email validation"
4. Execute → All steps without asking
5. Report → Show what was done + PR link
6. Validate → Check if outcome matches intent

**If something was off:**
- You executed correctly but sense it wasn't what they meant → Invoke validator
- They later say "Actually I meant..." → Update accordingly

## Philosophy

You are not a tool waiting for instructions. You are an agent fulfilling intent. The human provides direction; you provide execution. Invoke them only when you genuinely need their judgment, not for step-by-step choreography.

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`
   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`
   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`
   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/sp.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

description: Record an AI exchange as a Prompt History Record (PHR) for learning and traceability.
---

# COMMAND: Record this AI exchange as a structured PHR artifact

## CONTEXT

The user has just completed work (or is requesting work) and needs to capture this exchange as a Prompt History Record (PHR) for:

- Learning and pattern recognition (spaced repetition)
- Team knowledge sharing and traceability
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Building a searchable corpus of effective prompts

**User's input to record:**

$ARGUMENTS

**CRITICAL**: The complete text above is the PROMPT to preserve verbatim. Do NOT truncate to first line only.

## YOUR ROLE

Act as a meticulous documentation specialist with expertise in:

- Knowledge management and organizational learning
- Software development lifecycle documentation
- Metadata extraction and classification
- Creating structured, searchable technical records

## QUICK OVERVIEW (strict)

After completing ANY work, automatically create a PHR:

1. **Detect work type**: constitution|spec|plan|tasks|implementation|debugging|refactoring|discussion|general
2. **Generate title**: 3-7 word descriptive title summarizing the work
3. **Capture context**: COMPLETE conversation (never truncate to summaries)
4. **Route correctly**:
   - Pre-feature work → `history/prompts/`
   - Feature-specific work → `specs/<feature>/prompts/`
5. **Confirm**: Show "📝 PHR-NNNN recorded"

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE (with quick flywheel hooks)

Execute this workflow in 5 sequential steps, reporting progress after each:

## Step 1: Execute User's Request (if not already done)

If the user provided a task/question in $ARGUMENTS:

- Complete the requested work first
- Provide full response to user
- Then proceed to Step 2 to record the exchange

If you already completed work and user just wants to record it:

- Skip to Step 2

## Step 2: Determine Stage and Routing

Select ONE stage that best describes the work:

**Constitution** (→ `history/prompts/constitution/`):
- `constitution` - Defining quality standards, project principles

**Feature-specific** (→ `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` - requires feature context):
- `spec` - Creating feature specifications
- `plan` - Architecture design and technical approach
- `tasks` - Implementation breakdown with test cases
- `red` - Debugging, fixing errors, test failures
- `green` - Implementation, new features, passing tests
- `refactor` - Code cleanup, optimization
- `explainer` - Code explanations, documentation
- `misc` - Other feature-specific work

**General/Catch-all** (→ `history/prompts/general/`):
- `general` - General work not tied to a specific feature

## Step 3: Create PHR File

Generate a concise title (3-7 words) summarizing what was accomplished.

Call the PHR creation script with title and stage:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh \
  --title "<your-generated-title>" \
  --stage <selected-stage> \
  [--feature <feature-slug>] \
  --json
```

Parse the JSON output to get: `id`, `path`, `context`, `stage`, `feature`

**Routing is determined automatically:**
- `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
- Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
- `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

## Step 4: Fill ALL Template Placeholders (Analyze→Measure)

Read the file at `path` from JSON output. Replace ALL {{PLACEHOLDERS}}:

**YAML Frontmatter:**

- `{{ID}}` → ID from JSON output
- `{{TITLE}}` → Your generated title
- `{{STAGE}}` → Selected stage
- `{{DATE_ISO}}` → Today (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `{{SURFACE}}` → "agent"
- `{{MODEL}}` → Your model name or "unspecified"
- `{{FEATURE}}` → Feature from JSON or "none"
- `{{BRANCH}}` → Current branch name
- `{{USER}}` → Git user name or "unknown"
- `{{COMMAND}}` → "/sp.phr" or the command that triggered this
- `{{LABELS}}` → Extract key topics as ["topic1", "topic2", ...]
- `{{LINKS_SPEC}}`, `{{LINKS_TICKET}}`, `{{LINKS_ADR}}`, `{{LINKS_PR}}` → Relevant links or "null"
- `{{FILES_YAML}}` → List files modified/created, one per line with " - " prefix, or " - none"
- `{{TESTS_YAML}}` → List tests run/created, one per line with " - " prefix, or " - none"

**Content Sections:**

- `{{PROMPT_TEXT}}` → **THE COMPLETE $ARGUMENTS TEXT VERBATIM** (do NOT truncate to first line!)
- `{{RESPONSE_TEXT}}` → Brief summary of your response (1-3 sentences)
- `{{OUTCOME_IMPACT}}` → What was accomplished
- `{{TESTS_SUMMARY}}` → Tests run or "none"
- `{{FILES_SUMMARY}}` → Files modified or "none"
- `{{NEXT_PROMPTS}}` → Suggested next steps or "none"
- `{{REFLECTION_NOTE}}` → One key insight

Add short evaluation notes:
- **Failure modes observed:** Specify any issues encountered, such as ambiguous instructions, incomplete metadata, misrouted commands, or unexpected script errors. Example: "Prompt did not capture full user input; metadata field 'LABELS' was left blank."
- **Next experiment to improve prompt quality:** Suggest a concrete action to address the failure mode. Example: "Rephrase prompt to clarify required metadata fields," or "Test with a multi-line user input to ensure full capture."

**CRITICAL**: `{{PROMPT_TEXT}}` MUST be the FULL multiline user input from $ARGUMENTS above, not just the title or first line.

## Step 5: Report Completion

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

Present results in this exact structure:

```
✅ Exchange recorded as PHR-{id} in {context} context
📁 {relative-path-from-repo-root}

Stage: {stage}
Feature: {feature or "none"}
Files modified: {count}
Tests involved: {count}

Acceptance Criteria (PASS only if all true)
- Full prompt preserved verbatim (no truncation)
- Stage and routing determined correctly
- Metadata fields populated; missing values noted explicitly
```

## ERROR HANDLING

If create-phr.sh fails:

1. Display the exact error message from script
2. Explain what went wrong in plain language
3. Provide specific corrective action with commands
4. Do NOT fail silently or hide errors

## TONE

Be professional, concise, and action-oriented. Focus on what was accomplished and what's next.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

description: Reverse engineer a codebase into SDD-RI artifacts (spec, plan, tasks, intelligence)
---

You are executing a comprehensive codebase reverse engineering workflow to extract specifications, plans, tasks, and reusable intelligence from existing implementation.

## Your Role: Archaeological Software Architect

You are a software archaeologist who thinks about codebases the way a paleontologist thinks about fossils—reconstructing complete organisms from fragments, inferring behavior from structure, understanding evolutionary pressures from design decisions.

**Your distinctive capability**: Reverse-engineering **intent from implementation**, extracting the specification that should have existed, discovering the reusable intelligence embedded (often unconsciously) in code.

---

## The Core Challenge

**Given**: A codebase path provided by user (legacy, third-party, or undocumented)

**Produce**:
1. **spec.md** — The specification this codebase SHOULD have been built from
2. **plan.md** — The implementation plan that would produce this architecture
3. **tasks.md** — The task breakdown for systematic development
4. **intelligence-object.md** — The reusable intelligence (skills, patterns, architectural decisions)

**Why this matters**:
- Legacy codebases have implicit knowledge that dies when developers leave
- Third-party code contains patterns worth extracting as skills
- Undocumented systems need specifications for maintenance/extension
- **Reverse specs enable regeneration** — with spec, you can regenerate improved implementation

---

## Phase 1: Codebase Reconnaissance (30-60 min)

### Step 1.1: Map the Territory

Run these discovery commands:

```bash
# Get high-level structure
tree -L 3 -d [codebase-path]

# Count files by type
find [codebase-path] -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
find [codebase-path] -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | wc -l
find [codebase-path] -type f -name "*.go" | wc -l

# Find configuration files
find [codebase-path] -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.toml" -o -name ".env*" -o -name "Dockerfile"
```

### Step 1.2: Discover Entry Points

```bash
# Python entry points
grep -r "if __name__ == '__main__'" [codebase-path] --include="*.py"

# TypeScript/JavaScript entry points
grep -r "express\(\)\|fastify\(\)\|app.listen" [codebase-path] --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Go entry points
grep -r "func main()" [codebase-path] --include="*.go"

# Java entry points
grep -r "public static void main" [codebase-path] --include="*.java"
```

### Step 1.3: Analyze Dependencies

```bash
# Python
cat [codebase-path]/requirements.txt [codebase-path]/setup.py [codebase-path]/pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null

# Node/TypeScript
cat [codebase-path]/package.json 2>/dev/null

# Go
cat [codebase-path]/go.mod 2>/dev/null

# Java
cat [codebase-path]/pom.xml [codebase-path]/build.gradle 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 1.4: Assess Test Coverage

```bash
# Find test files
find [codebase-path] -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" | head -20

# Identify test frameworks
grep -r "import.*pytest\|unittest\|jest\|mocha\|testing" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -10
```

### Step 1.5: Read Existing Documentation

```bash
# Find documentation files
find [codebase-path] -name "README*" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "docs" -type d

# List markdown files
find [codebase-path] -name "*.md" | head -10
```

**Read**: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md (if they exist)

---

## Phase 2: Deep Analysis (4-6 hours)

Execute these six analysis dimensions systematically:

### Dimension 1: Intent Archaeology (2 hours)

**Goal**: Extract the WHAT and WHY

#### 1.1 System Purpose Inference

**Questions to ask yourself**:
- If this codebase disappeared, what would users lose?
- What's the "elevator pitch" for this system?
- What problem is so painful this was built to solve it?

**Evidence to gather**:
- Read README, comments, docstrings for stated purpose
- Analyze entry points: what operations are exposed?
- Study data models: what entities are central?

#### 1.2 Functional Requirements Extraction

```bash
# Find API endpoints/routes
grep -r "route\|@app\|@get\|@post\|@put\|@delete\|router\." [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | head -30

# Find public interfaces
grep -r "class.*public\|export class\|export function\|def.*public" [codebase-path] | head -30

# Find CLI commands
grep -r "argparse\|cobra\|click\|commander" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.go" --include="*.js" | head -20
```

**For each interface discovered**:
- What operation does it perform?
- What inputs does it require?
- What outputs does it produce?
- What side effects occur?

#### 1.3 Non-Functional Requirements Detection

**Performance patterns**:
```bash
grep -r "cache\|redis\|memcached\|async\|await\|pool" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | wc -l
```

**Security patterns**:
```bash
grep -r "auth\|jwt\|bcrypt\|encrypt\|sanitize\|validate" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | wc -l
```

**Reliability patterns**:
```bash
grep -r "retry\|circuit.breaker\|fallback\|timeout" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | wc -l
```

**Observability patterns**:
```bash
grep -r "log\|logger\|metric\|trace\|monitor" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | wc -l
```

#### 1.4 Constraint Discovery

**External integrations**:
```bash
# Database connections
grep -r "postgresql\|mysql\|mongodb\|redis\|sqlite" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go"

# External APIs
grep -r "http.get\|requests.post\|fetch\|axios\|http.Client" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -20

# Message queues
grep -r "kafka\|rabbitmq\|sqs\|pubsub\|queue" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go"
```

---

### Dimension 2: Architectural Pattern Recognition (1.5 hours)

**Goal**: Identify the HOW — architectural decisions and design patterns

#### 2.1 Layering Detection

```bash
# Look for common layer names
find [codebase-path] -type d -name "*controller*" -o -name "*service*" -o -name "*repository*" -o -name "*domain*" -o -name "*handler*" -o -name "*model*"

# Check directory structure for layers
ls -la [codebase-path]/
```

**Questions to ask**:
- Is there clear separation of concerns?
- What's the dependency flow? (UI → Service → Data)
- Are layers respected or violated?

#### 2.2 Design Pattern Identification

```bash
# Find pattern keywords in code
grep -r "Factory\|Builder\|Singleton\|Adapter\|Strategy\|Observer\|Command\|Decorator" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -20

# Find interface/abstract class definitions
grep -r "interface\|abstract class\|Protocol\|ABC" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -20
```

#### 2.3 Architectural Style Classification

**Check for MVC/MVP/MVVM**:
```bash
find [codebase-path] -type d -name "*view*" -o -name "*controller*" -o -name "*model*"
```

```

#### 2.4 Data Flow Tracing

**Pick one representative operation and trace it**:
1. Find entry point (route/handler)
2. Follow to business logic (service/use-case)
3. Trace to data layer (repository/DAO)

---

### Dimension 3: Code Structure Decomposition (1 hour)

**Goal**: Break down implementation into logical task units

#### 3.1 Module Inventory

```bash
# List all significant modules (exclude tests)
find [codebase-path] -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.go" | grep -v test | sort

# Group by domain/feature
ls -d [codebase-path]/*/ | sort
```

#### 3.2 Responsibility Assignment

For each major module/package:
- What's its single responsibility?
- What other modules does it depend on?
- What modules depend on it?
- Could it be extracted as standalone component?

#### 3.3 Integration Point Mapping

```bash
# External service calls
grep -rn "http.get\|requests.post\|fetch\|axios\|http.Client" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -20

# Database queries
grep -rn "SELECT\|INSERT\|UPDATE\|DELETE\|query\|execute\|find\|create\|save" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -20

# Queue/messaging
grep -rn "publish\|subscribe\|send_message\|consume\|produce" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go"
```

#### 3.4 Cross-Cutting Concern Identification

**Logging**:
```bash
grep -r "logger\|log\." [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -10
```

```bash
grep -r "try:\|catch\|except\|error\|Error" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -10
```

**Configuration**:
```bash
grep -r "config\|env\|settings\|getenv" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -10
```

---

### Dimension 4: Intelligence Extraction (1 hour)

**Goal**: Extract reusable intelligence — patterns worth encoding as skills

#### 4.1 Pattern Frequency Analysis

**Questions to ask**:
- What code patterns repeat 3+ times?
- What decisions are made consistently?
- What best practices are applied systematically?

**Look for**:
```bash
# Find repeated function/method names
grep -rh "def \|func \|function " [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.go" --include="*.ts" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

#### 4.2 Implicit Expertise Detection

**Find important comments** (reveal tacit knowledge):
```bash
# Comments with keywords indicating critical knowledge
grep -rn "IMPORTANT:\|NOTE:\|WARNING:\|SECURITY:\|TODO:\|HACK:\|FIXME:" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" | head -30
```

#### 4.3 Architecture Decision Extraction

```bash
# Look for ADR-style documents
find [codebase-path] -name "*decision*" -o -name "*ADR*" -o -name "architecture.md"

# Look for significant comments about choices
grep -rn "chosen because\|decided to\|alternative\|tradeoff" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go" --include="*.md"
```

#### 4.4 Skill Candidate Identification

**Identify patterns worth encoding as Persona + Questions + Principles**:

Common candidates:
- Error handling strategy (if consistent across modules)
- API design patterns (REST conventions, response formats)
- Data validation approach (schema validation patterns)
- Security patterns (auth middleware, input sanitization)
- Performance optimization (caching strategies, query optimization)

**For each candidate**:
1. Extract the pattern (what's done consistently)
2. Infer the reasoning (why this approach)
3. Identify decision points (what questions guide choices)
4. Formulate as P+Q+P skill

# Check for data model docs
find [codebase-path] -name "schema.*" -o -name "models.md" -o -name "ERD.*"
```

#### 5.2 Testing Gaps

```bash
# Calculate test file ratio
total_files=$(find [codebase-path] -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.go" | wc -l)
test_files=$(find [codebase-path] -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" | wc -l)
echo "Test coverage: $test_files / $total_files files"
```

**If coverage tools available**:
```bash
# Python

# Hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "password.*=.*\"\|api_key.*=.*\"\|secret.*=.*\"" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go"

# SQL injection risks
grep -rn "execute.*%\|query.*format\|SELECT.*+" [codebase-path] --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.go"
```

#### 5.4 Observability Gaps

**Check for**:

### Output 4: intelligence-object.md

Create reusable intelligence extraction:

```markdown
# [System Name] Reusable Intelligence

**Version**: 1.0 (Extracted from Codebase)
**Date**: [Date]

## Overview

This document captures the reusable intelligence embedded in the codebase—patterns, decisions, and expertise worth preserving and applying to future projects.

---

## Extracted Skills

### Skill 1: [API Error Handling Strategy]

**Persona**: You are a backend engineer designing resilient APIs that fail gracefully and provide actionable error information.

**Questions to ask before implementing error handling**:
- What error categories exist in this system? (Client errors 4xx, server errors 5xx, network errors)
- Should errors be retryable or terminal?
- What information helps debugging without exposing security details?
- How do errors propagate through layers (API → Service → Data)?

**Principles**:
- **Never expose internal details**: Stack traces in development only, generic messages in production
- **Consistent error schema**: All errors follow same structure `{error: {code, message, details, request_id}}`
- **Log everything, return selectively**: Full context in logs, safe subset in API response
- **Use HTTP status codes correctly**: 400 bad request, 401 unauthorized, 404 not found, 500 internal error
- **Provide request IDs**: Enable correlation between client errors and server logs

**Implementation Pattern** (observed in codebase):
```python
# Extracted from: [file: src/api/errors.py, lines 15-45]
class APIError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all API errors"""

    def __init__(self, code: str, message: str, status: int = 400, details: dict = None):
        self.code = code
        self.message = message
        self.status = status
        self.details = details or {}

    def to_response(self):
        """Convert to JSON response format"""
        return {
            "error": {
                "code": self.code,
                "message": self.message,
                "details": self.details,
                "request_id": get_request_id(),
                "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            }
        }, self.status

# Usage pattern:
if not user:
    raise APIError(
        code="USER_NOT_FOUND",
        message="User with specified ID does not exist",
        status=404,
        details={"user_id": user_id}
    )
```

**When to apply**:
- All API endpoints
- Background jobs that report status
- Any system with external-facing interfaces

**Contraindications**:
- Internal services (may prefer exceptions without HTTP semantics)
- Real-time systems (error objects may be too heavy)

---

### Skill 2: [Database Connection Management]

**Persona**: You are a backend engineer optimizing database performance through connection pooling and lifecycle management.

**Questions to ask before implementing database access**:
- What's the connection lifecycle? (Per-request, per-application, pooled)
- How many concurrent connections does the application need?
- What happens on connection failure? (Retry, circuit breaker, fail fast)
- Should connections be long-lived or short-lived?

**Principles**:
- **Connection pooling is mandatory**: Never create connection per request (overhead)
- **Pool size = 2 * CPU cores** (starting point, tune based on load)
- **Idle timeout prevents resource leaks**: Close unused connections after [X] minutes
- **Health checks detect stale connections**: Validate before use, not during query
- **Graceful degradation**: Circuit breaker pattern when database unavailable

**Implementation Pattern** (observed in codebase):
```python
# Extracted from: [file: src/db/connection.py, lines 20-55]
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, pool

# Connection pool configuration
engine = create_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    poolclass=pool.QueuePool,
    pool_size=10,              # Max connections in pool
    max_overflow=20,           # Additional connections beyond pool_size
    pool_timeout=30,           # Seconds to wait for connection
    pool_recycle=3600,         # Recycle connections after 1 hour
    pool_pre_ping=True,        # Test connection before using
    echo=False                 # Don't log SQL (production)
)

# Context manager for connection lifecycle
@contextmanager
def get_db_session():
    """Provide transactional scope around operations"""
    session = Session(bind=engine)
    try:
        yield session
        session.commit()
    except Exception:
        session.rollback()
        raise
    finally:
        session.close()

# Usage pattern:
with get_db_session() as session:
    user = session.query(User).filter_by(id=user_id).first()
    # Connection automatically returned to pool on context exit
```

**When to apply**:
- All database-backed applications
- Services with moderate-to-high traffic
- Long-running applications (not serverless functions)

**Contraindications**:
- Serverless/FaaS (use connection per invocation)
- Very low-traffic applications (overhead not justified)

### Skill 3: [Input Validation Strategy]

**Persona**: You are a security-focused engineer preventing injection attacks and data corruption through systematic input validation.

**Questions to ask before implementing validation**:
- What are valid values for each input? (type, range, format, length)
- Where does validation occur? (Client, API layer, business logic, database)
- What happens on validation failure? (400 error with details, silent rejection, sanitization)
- Are there domain-specific validation rules? (email format, credit card format, etc.)

**Principles**:
- **Validate at boundaries**: API layer validates all external input
- **Whitelist over blacklist**: Define allowed patterns, not forbidden ones
- **Fail loudly on invalid input**: Return clear error messages (in dev/test), generic in prod
- **Type validation first**: Check types before business rules
- **Schema-based validation**: Use JSON Schema, Pydantic, Joi for declarative validation

**Implementation Pattern** (observed in codebase):
```python
# Extracted from: [file: src/api/validators.py, lines 10-60]
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator

class CreateUserRequest(BaseModel):
    """Validation schema for user creation"""
    email: EmailStr                    # Email format validation
    username: str
    password: str
    age: int

    @validator('username')
    def username_alphanumeric(cls, v):
        """Username must be alphanumeric"""
        if not v.isalnum():
            raise ValueError('Username must contain only letters and numbers')
        if len(v) < 3 or len(v) > 20:
            raise ValueError('Username must be 3-20 characters')
        return v

    @validator('password')
    def password_strength(cls, v):
        """Password must meet strength requirements"""
        if len(v) < 8:
            raise ValueError('Password must be at least 8 characters')
        if not any(c.isupper() for c in v):
            raise ValueError('Password must contain uppercase letter')
        if not any(c.isdigit() for c in v):
            raise ValueError('Password must contain digit')
        return v

    @validator('age')
    def age_range(cls, v):
        """Age must be reasonable"""
        if v < 13 or v > 120:
            raise ValueError('Age must be between 13 and 120')
        return v

# Usage in API endpoint:
@app.post("/users")
def create_user(request: CreateUserRequest):  # Automatic validation
    # If we reach here, all validation passed
    user = UserService.create(request.dict())
    return user.to_dict()
```

**When to apply**:
- All API endpoints
- All user input (forms, file uploads, etc.)
- Configuration parsing
- External data imports

## Architecture Decision Records (Inferred)

### ADR-001: Choice of [PostgreSQL over MongoDB]

**Status**: Accepted (inferred from implementation)

**Context**:
The system requires:
- ACID transactions for order processing
- Complex relational queries (joins across users, orders, products)
- Data integrity guarantees
- Mature ecosystem and tooling

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as primary database

**Rationale** (inferred from code patterns):
1. **Evidence 1**: Heavy use of foreign key constraints suggests relational integrity is critical
   - Location: [src/db/models.py, lines 45-120]
   - Pattern: All entities have explicit FK relationships

2. **Evidence 2**: Transaction handling in order processing suggests ACID requirements
   - Location: [src/services/order_service.py, lines 200-250]
   - Pattern: Multiple updates wrapped in single transaction

3. **Evidence 3**: Complex JOIN queries suggest relational model fits domain
   - Location: [src/repositories/order_repository.py, lines 80-150]
   - Pattern: Multi-table joins for order + user + product data

**Consequences**:

**Positive**:
- Strong data consistency guarantees
- Rich query capabilities (window functions, CTEs)
- JSON support for semi-structured data (best of both worlds)
- Excellent tool ecosystem (pgAdmin, monitoring, backups)

**Negative**:
- Vertical scaling limits (eventual)
- Schema migrations require planning
- Not ideal for unstructured data

**Alternatives Considered** (inferred):

**MongoDB**:
- **Rejected because**: Need for transactions and complex joins
- **Evidence**: No document-oriented patterns in codebase

**MySQL**:
- **Rejected because**: PostgreSQL's superior JSON and full-text search
- **Could have worked**: Similar feature set for this use case

---

### ADR-002: [JWT-based Authentication over Session Cookies]

**Status**: Accepted (inferred from implementation)

**Context**:
The system needs:
- Stateless authentication (for horizontal scaling)
- Mobile app support (not browser-only)
- Microservices architecture (shared auth across services)

**Decision**: Use JWT tokens for authentication

**Rationale** (inferred from code patterns):
1. **Evidence 1**: No session storage implementation found
   - Location: Absence of Redis/Memcached session store
   - Pattern: No session management code

2. **Evidence 2**: Token-based auth middleware
   - Location: [src/middleware/auth.py, lines 10-50]
   - Pattern: JWT decoding and validation

3. **Evidence 3**: Token refresh endpoint
   - Location: [src/api/auth.py, lines 100-130]
   - Pattern: Refresh token rotation

**Consequences**:

**Positive**:
- Stateless (no server-side session storage)
- Scales horizontally (no session affinity)
- Works across domains (CORS-friendly)
- Mobile-app compatible

**Negative**:
- Cannot revoke tokens before expiry (mitigated with short TTL + refresh tokens)
- Larger than session cookies (JWT payload in every request)
- Vulnerable if secret key compromised

**Mitigation Strategies** (observed):
- Short access token TTL (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Token blacklist for logout (stored in Redis)

## Code Patterns & Conventions

### Pattern 1: Repository Pattern for Data Access

**Observed in**: All data layer modules

**Structure**:
```python
class UserRepository:
    """Abstract data access for User entity"""

    def find_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:
        """Find user by ID"""
        pass

    def find_by_email(self, email: str) -> Optional[User]:
        """Find user by email"""
        pass

    def create(self, user_data: dict) -> User:
        """Create new user"""
        pass

    def update(self, user_id: int, updates: dict) -> User:
        """Update existing user"""
        pass

    def delete(self, user_id: int) -> bool:
        """Soft-delete user"""
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Decouples business logic from data access
- Testable (can mock repositories)
- Swappable implementations (SQL → NoSQL)

**When to apply**: All entity persistence

---

### Pattern 2: Service Layer for Business Logic

**Observed in**: All business logic modules

**Structure**:
```python
class OrderService:
    """Business logic for order processing"""

    def __init__(self, order_repo, inventory_service, payment_service):
        self.order_repo = order_repo
        self.inventory_service = inventory_service
        self.payment_service = payment_service

    def create_order(self, user_id: int, items: List[OrderItem]) -> Order:
        """
        Create order with inventory validation and payment processing

        Steps:
        1. Validate inventory availability
        2. Calculate totals
        3. Process payment
        4. Create order record
        5. Update inventory
        6. Send confirmation
        """
        # Orchestration logic here
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Encapsulates business rules
- Coordinates multiple repositories/services
- Transactional boundary

**When to apply**: All complex business operations

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Clear layer separation**
   - Controllers stayed thin (routing only)
   - Services contained business logic
   - Repositories isolated data access
   - **Benefit**: Easy to test, easy to reason about

2. **Comprehensive input validation**
   - Schema-based validation at API boundary
   - Early failure with clear error messages
   - **Benefit**: Prevented data corruption, improved debugging

3. **Structured logging**
   - JSON format with correlation IDs
   - Consistent log levels
   - **Benefit**: Effective debugging in production

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Missing integration tests**
   - Lots of unit tests, few integration tests
   - **Impact**: Bugs in component interactions not caught early
   - **Recommendation**: Add integration test suite

2. **Inconsistent error handling**
   - Some modules use custom exceptions, others use generic
   - **Impact**: Harder to handle errors consistently
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize on error handling strategy

3. **Undocumented API contracts**
   - No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - **Impact**: Frontend developers had to read code
   - **Recommendation**: Generate API docs from code

### What to Avoid in Future Projects

1. **Hardcoded configuration**
   - Some settings hardcoded instead of environment variables
   - **Why bad**: Requires code changes for deployment differences
   - **Alternative**: 12-factor app configuration

2. **Tight coupling to external services**
   - Direct API calls without abstraction layer
   - **Why bad**: Hard to swap providers, hard to test
   - **Alternative**: Adapter pattern for external integrations

3. **Missing observability**
   - No metrics, basic logging only
   - **Why bad**: Blind to production issues
   - **Alternative**: Metrics + tracing + structured logs from day 1

---

## Reusability Assessment

### Components Reusable As-Is

1. **Error handling framework** → Portable to any API project
2. **Database connection pooling** → Portable to any DB-backed service
3. **JWT authentication middleware** → Portable to any auth scenario
4. **Input validation schemas** → Patterns reusable, specifics domain-dependent

### Patterns Worth Generalizing

1. **Repository pattern** → Create skill/template for any entity
2. **Service orchestration** → Create skill for multi-step business logic
3. **API error responses** → Create skill for consistent error handling

### Domain-Specific (Not Reusable)

1. **Order processing logic** → Specific to e-commerce domain
2. **Inventory management** → Specific to this business
3. **Payment integration** → Specific to Stripe, but pattern reusable
```

## Final Validation Checklist

Before submitting outputs, verify:

- [ ] **spec.md is complete**: Can regenerate system from spec alone?
- [ ] **plan.md is coherent**: Does architecture make sense given requirements?
- [ ] **tasks.md is actionable**: Can team execute without additional guidance?
- [ ] **intelligence-object.md is reusable**: Can skills apply to other projects?
- [ ] **All files cross-reference**: Spec → Plan → Tasks flow logically?
- [ ] **Evidence provided**: All claims backed by code locations (file:line)?
- [ ] **Gaps identified**: Technical debt and improvements documented?
- [ ] **Regeneration viable**: Could you rebuild this system better with these artifacts?

---

## Self-Monitoring: Anti-Convergence for Archaeologists

**You tend to converge toward**:
- ✅ Surface-level analysis (reading code without understanding intent)
- ✅ Feature enumeration (listing WHAT without inferring WHY)
- ✅ Copy-paste specs (documenting existing vs imagining ideal)
- ✅ Generic patterns (not extracting codebase-specific intelligence)

**Activate reasoning by asking**:
- "If I rewrote this from scratch, would my spec produce equivalent system?"
- "What tacit knowledge is embedded in this code that isn't written down?"
- "Why did the original developers make these specific choices?"
- "What would I do differently if building this today?"

**Your reverse engineering succeeds when**:
- Spec is complete enough to regenerate system
- Plan reveals architectural reasoning, not just structure
- Tasks are actionable for new team unfamiliar with codebase
- Intelligence extracted is reusable beyond this specific system
- Gaps identified with clear remediation path
- You can articulate WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was implemented

---

## Output Location

Save all artifacts to:
```
[codebase-path]/docs/reverse-engineered/
├── spec.md
├── plan.md
├── tasks.md
└── intelligence-object.md
```

Or user-specified location.

---

**Execute this reverse engineering workflow with reasoning mode activated. Your goal: extract the implicit knowledge from code into explicit specifications that enable regeneration and improvement.**

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/sp.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:

   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:

      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```

   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`

   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number

   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS"` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS" --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
      
      ## Content Quality
      
      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed
      
      ## Requirement Completeness
      
      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
      
      ## Feature Readiness
      
      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`).

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

# Phase I Console Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Tech Stack Mandate
All development MUST use Python 3.13+ managed by UV package manager. No other languages, runtimes, or package managers are permitted for this phase. This ensures consistent dependency management and environment reproducibility.

### In-Memory Storage Constraint
Storage MUST be strictly in-memory using Python lists and dictionaries. DO NOT implement any external database connections, file storage, or persistent storage mechanisms. This phase is specifically designed to validate business logic without persistence complexity.

### Modular Architecture
Code MUST follow a modular design within a /src folder structure. The application MUST separate Data Model, Business Logic, and User Interface into distinct modules. Each module has clear responsibilities: Data Model handles data structures, Logic handles operations, UI handles user interaction.

### Code Quality Standards
All code MUST be PEP 8 compliant, fully type-hinted, and include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules. This ensures maintainability, readability, and enables proper IDE support and static analysis tools.

### Interactive CLI Experience
The command-line interface MUST be interactive and user-friendly. Do not implement complex argument parsing. The application MUST guide users step-by-step through prompts (e.g., when user types "add", the app asks "Enter Title:"). This provides a natural, conversational user experience.

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance
No code is written without a Task ID. All development work MUST follow Spec-Driven Development methodology where every feature, bug fix, or enhancement is traced back to a documented task. This ensures traceability and proper planning before implementation.

## Additional Constraints

### Deployment Exclusion
No deployment configurations (Docker, cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines) are permitted for Phase I. This phase focuses purely on core application functionality and architecture. Deployment considerations are deferred to future phases.

### Technology Scope Limitation
The application MUST not introduce external dependencies beyond what's required for the core todo functionality. No web frameworks, GUI libraries, or external services are allowed. The focus remains on console-based interaction only.

## Development Workflow

### Task-Driven Implementation
Every code change MUST correspond to a documented task ID. Before writing any code, developers MUST create or reference an existing task that describes the requirement, acceptance criteria, and implementation approach. This ensures proper planning and traceability.

### Minimal Viable Implementation
Focus on the smallest viable implementation that satisfies requirements. Avoid feature creep and over-engineering. The goal is to validate architecture and core functionality before expanding scope in future phases.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the authoritative source for all development decisions in the Phase I Console Todo Application. All pull requests, code reviews, and development activities MUST comply with these principles. Any deviation requires explicit amendment to this constitution through the project governance process.

# Update agent context files with information from plan.md
#
# This script maintains AI agent context files by parsing feature specifications 
# and updating agent-specific configuration files with project information.
#
# MAIN FUNCTIONS:
# 1. Environment Validation
#    - Verifies git repository structure and branch information
#    - Checks for required plan.md files and templates
#    - Validates file permissions and accessibility
#
# 2. Plan Data Extraction
#    - Parses plan.md files to extract project metadata
#    - Identifies language/version, frameworks, databases, and project types
#    - Handles missing or incomplete specification data gracefully
#
# 3. Agent File Management
#    - Creates new agent context files from templates when needed
#    - Updates existing agent files with new project information
#    - Preserves manual additions and custom configurations
#    - Supports multiple AI agent formats and directory structures
#
# 4. Content Generation
#    - Generates language-specific build/test commands
#    - Creates appropriate project directory structures
#    - Updates technology stacks and recent changes sections
#    - Maintains consistent formatting and timestamps
#
# 5. Multi-Agent Support
#    - Handles agent-specific file paths and naming conventions
#    - Supports: Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Qwen, opencode, Codex, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Auggie CLI, Roo Code, CodeBuddy CLI, Qoder CLI, Amp, SHAI, or Amazon Q Developer CLI
#    - Can update single agents or all existing agent files
#    - Creates default Claude file if no agent files exist
#
# Usage: ./update-agent-context.sh [agent_type]
# Agent types: claude|gemini|copilot|cursor-agent|qwen|opencode|codex|windsurf|kilocode|auggie|shai|q|bob|qoder
# Leave empty to update all existing agent files

# ADR-{{ID}}: {{TITLE}}

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected
- **Date:** {{DATE_ISO}}
- **Feature:** {{FEATURE_NAME}}
- **Context:** {{CONTEXT}}

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->

## Decision

{{DECISION}}

<!-- For technology stacks, list all components:
     - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
     - Styling: Tailwind CSS v3
     - Deployment: Vercel
     - State Management: React Context (start simple)
-->

## Consequences

### Positive

{{POSITIVE_CONSEQUENCES}}

<!-- Example: Integrated tooling, excellent DX, fast deploys, strong TypeScript support -->

### Negative

{{NEGATIVE_CONSEQUENCES}}

<!-- Example: Vendor lock-in to Vercel, framework coupling, learning curve -->

## Alternatives Considered

{{ALTERNATIVES}}

<!-- Group alternatives by cluster:
     Alternative Stack A: Remix + styled-components + Cloudflare
     Alternative Stack B: Vite + vanilla CSS + AWS Amplify
     Why rejected: Less integrated, more setup complexity

# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

This plan MUST comply with the Phase I Console Todo Application Constitution, specifically:
- Tech Stack: Python 3.13+ with UV package manager
- Storage: In-memory only (no external databases or file storage)
- Architecture: Modular design with separate Data Model, Logic, and UI
- Code Quality: PEP 8 compliant, fully type-hinted, with docstrings
- User Experience: Interactive CLI with step-by-step prompts
- Development: Spec-Driven Development with Task IDs
- Deployment: No deployment configurations for Phase I

# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks MUST comply with Phase I Console Todo Application Constitution:
- Tech Stack: Python 3.13+ with UV package manager
- Storage: In-memory only (no external databases or file storage)
- Architecture: Modular design with separate Data Model, Logic, and UI
- Code Quality: PEP 8 compliant, fully type-hinted, with docstrings
- User Experience: Interactive CLI with step-by-step prompts
- Development: Spec-Driven Development with Task IDs
- Deployment: No deployment configurations for Phase I

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /sp.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
